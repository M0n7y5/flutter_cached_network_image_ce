## [4.13.0] - 2026-09-26

* **Feature:** `maxWidthDiskCache` / `maxHeightDiskCache` now resize WebP images on disk. Before, WebP files were stored at full size. As with JPEG and PNG, this applies when the URL path ends in `.webp`. Requested in issue #78.
* **Fix:** Animated images (animated WebP, APNG) are no longer resized on disk. Resizing keeps only the first frame, so they are cached as the original file and keep animating.

## [4.12.0] - 2026-09-08

* **Feature:** Added `animate` to `CachedNetworkImage` and `CachedNetworkImageProvider` (default `true`). With `animate: false` a multi-frame image such as a GIF shows its first frame and stops there, without decoding the rest. `animate` is part of the provider key, so toggling it at runtime resolves a different image stream: the widget paints nothing while that stream resolves, and which frame it starts on depends on what the `ImageCache` still holds. Wrap the widget in a `TickerMode` to pause and resume an animation in place. Requested in issue #21.
* **Fix:** `CachedNetworkImage.evictFromCache` now forwards `cacheKey` to the provider it evicts and clears both the `animate: true` and `animate: false` entries, so the in-memory `ImageCache` eviction is no longer a silent no-op for images rendered with a `cacheKey` or with `animate: false`.

## [4.11.1] - 2026-09-08

* **Fix:** Images turned black on web after the widget was scrolled out of view and back. `MultiImageStreamCompleter` re-decoded the codec on every 0→1 listener transition; for a single-frame image on CanvasKit that produces a second lazy `ui.Image` sharing one `<img>` element, and emitting it disposes the previous image, which clears that element's `src`. The already decoded frame is now handed to the returning listener instead. Animated images still resume decoding. Reported by [@tranhuudang](https://github.com/tranhuudang) (issue #67).
* **Fix:** The completer handed the codec's own `ui.Image` to `ImageInfo` instead of a clone and never disposed `_nextFrame`, so every decode that was abandoned (listener dropped mid-decode) or superseded leaked a `ui.Image`. Frames are now cloned into `ImageInfo` and the decoded frame is disposed once handed over, matching the framework's `MultiFrameImageStreamCompleter`. That is also the ownership bug behind the black image above: `setImage` disposing the previous `ImageInfo` no longer releases a handle the codec's decoded frame still owns.
* **Fix:** A frame could be emitted under a codec that had already replaced the one it was decoded from. `_decodeNextFrameAndSchedule` now captures its codec and discards the frame if the codec changed during the await, instead of evaluating `frameCount` against the new codec — which could terminate a running animation and mis-count the new codec's frames.
* **Fix:** Adding a listener while a decode was already in flight started a second, concurrent decode of the same codec, so two frames could be emitted and dispose each other's image. `addListener` no longer starts a decode while one is pending.
* **Fix:** A null-check crash when a replacement codec arrived between an animated frame being decoded and its scheduled app-frame callback running, or when a listener removed and re-added itself from the `setImage` callback. Both released the pending frame while `_handleAppFrame` was still reading it. The callback now takes the frame before notifying listeners and returns quietly if the frame it was scheduled for is already gone, and decoding a codec that already has a frame in flight is a no-op.
* **Fix:** Replaced codecs are now disposed instead of dropped, so a cache hit followed by a network refresh no longer retains the outgoing decoder for the life of the completer. A codec replaced while one of its frames is still decoding is disposed by that decode when it returns, since disposing it earlier would fail the pending `getNextFrame()`.

## [4.11.0] - 2026-09-01

* **Feature:** Added `CachedNetworkImage.preCache()` static method for downloading and caching images without rendering them. Useful for warming the cache before navigation. Supports optional `cacheKey`, `headers`, custom `cacheManager`, disk-resize parameters (`maxWidthDiskCache`, `maxHeightDiskCache`), and an optional `timeout`. Throws a `StateError` instead of silently returning a stale file when refreshing an expired cache entry fails, and an `ArgumentError` (not just an `assert`) when resize parameters are used with a `CacheManager` that isn't an `ImageCacheManager`.

## [4.10.1] - 2026-08-26

* **Fix:** `PathNotFoundException` when the background cleanup sweep deleted a cached file after `getFileFromCache` had already handed out its `FileInfo` but before the image was read. The sweep starts unawaited during initialization, so on cold start every first-frame load raced it. A cached file that disappears mid-read now falls back to a fresh download instead of throwing. Applies to the resize path too, which reads the separately-evictable original entry.
* **Fix:** `getImageFile` removed its in-flight resize entry only after its stream completed, so abandoning that stream left every later call for the same key waiting on a stream that had already finished, and no image was ever delivered.
* **Fix:** `putFile` now awaits its Hive metadata write instead of returning while the write is still unsequenced.
* **Behaviour change:** The cleanup sweep skips entries served within the last 30 seconds, so an image still being loaded is not evicted out from under its reader. Skipped entries lose their place in the eviction order but not the size budget, so `maxNrOfCacheObjects` is still honoured.

## [4.10.0] - 2026-07-30

* **Performance:** `DefaultCacheManager` now reuses a single HTTP client across downloads instead of creating and closing one per request, so connections can be kept alive between images.
* **Fix:** A connection timeout now aborts the in-flight request instead of leaving it running in the background.
* **Fix:** `dispose()` closes the reused client. Downloads started after disposal create their own client, which is closed once its last response is released.
* **Behaviour change:** `dispose()` called while a download is in flight now aborts that download; previously each download owned its client and could outlive `dispose()`.
* **Behaviour change:** An `onResponse` interceptor that replaces the response must not derive the replacement body from the original response's stream — the original body is now canceled as soon as it is replaced, to release its connection.

## [4.9.1] - 2026-07-23

* **Fix:** Codec decode failures (e.g. JXL, or AVIF/HEIC on platforms without native support) now route to `unsupportedImageBuilder` instead of `errorBuilder`. Previously only pre-detected formats (SVG) were routed this way via `UnsupportedImageFormatException`; any other codec decode failure fell through as a generic, untyped error.

## [4.9.0] - 2026-06-19

* **Feature:** Added `metadataDirectoryProvider` to `DefaultCacheManager` so Hive metadata can be stored separately from cached image files on IO platforms.
* **Fix:** Isolate the orphan-file cleanup sweep per metadata directory, so two `DefaultCacheManager` instances sharing a `cacheDirectoryProvider` but different `metadataDirectoryProvider` no longer delete each other's files. `dispose()` now awaits any in-flight sweep instead of racing it.

## [4.8.0] - 2026-06-16

* **Feature:** Added LRU cache cleanup support to `DefaultCacheManager`.
  * New `CleanupStrategy` abstraction controls eviction order when the cache exceeds `maxNrOfCacheObjects`.
  * `TtlCleanupStrategy` — evicts soonest-to-expire entries first. Matches prior behaviour and remains the default.
  * `LruCleanupStrategy` — evicts least-recently-used entries first, based on a new `touchedAt` timestamp updated on every cache hit.
  * `CacheEntryMetadata` gains a nullable `touchedAt` field; legacy entries without it fall back to `validTill` via `effectiveTouchedAt`.
  * Pass a strategy via the new `cleanupStrategy` parameter on `DefaultCacheManager`, or implement `CleanupStrategy` for a custom eviction policy.

## [4.7.0] - 2026-06-10

* **Feature:** Added HTTP and cache interceptor support to `DefaultCacheManager`.
  * `HttpInterceptor` — intercept, mutate, or short-circuit HTTP requests, responses, and errors before they reach the cache layer.
  * `CacheInterceptor` — intercept cache hit, miss, and store events. Reject a hit to force re-download; resolve a miss to inject a synthetic file; reject a store to skip writing metadata to Hive.
  * Pass interceptors via the new `httpInterceptors` and `cacheInterceptors` parameters on `DefaultCacheManager`.
  * `CacheInterceptor` and its handler types are only available on native IO targets; a no-op stub is exported for web.
  * Full test coverage for all interceptor chain paths.

## [4.6.4] - 2026-03-24

* **Fix:** Resolve `HiveError` crashes caused by URL string keys exceeding 255 characters. Long cache keys are now automatically hashed using SHA-256 to remain under Hive's 255-character length limit.

## [4.6.3] - 2026-03-15

* **Fix:** Handle exceptions when closing the Hive cache box and Hive instance during `dispose()`. (PR #17)
  * `PathNotFoundException` (e.g. when the cache directory was deleted before dispose) is now silently swallowed so callers can dispose without wrapping in try-catch.
* **Feat:** Ensure the cache directory exists before any file read/write operation. (PR #17)
  * Prevents `PathNotFoundException` on first use when the OS or test harness removes the temp directory between initialisation and the first cache put/get.
* Added regression tests for cache-directory resilience and for safe disposal after `emptyCache()`. (PR #17)

## [4.6.2] - 2026-03-04

* **Fix:** Handle Hive box corruption gracefully during cache initialization.
  * When `openBox` encounters a corrupted box with unknown typeIds (e.g., from removed adapters), catch `HiveError`, safely delete the box, and retry initialization.
  * Cleans up orphaned cache files after box recovery to prevent stale data.
  * Regression tests added for box corruption recovery on both IO and web platforms.
  * Issue #12: Fixes production crash "HiveError: Cannot read, unknown typeId" reported via Firebase Crashlytics.

## [4.6.1] - 2026-03-04

* **Fix:** Re-export `ConnectionParameters` from the main `cached_network_image_ce` barrel file so it is accessible without a separate `cached_network_image_platform_interface_ce` import.
* **Fix:** Added missing `connectionParameters` parameter to the stub `DefaultCacheManager` for unsupported platforms.
* Added example demonstrating `DefaultCacheManager` with `ConnectionParameters`.

## [4.6.0] - 2026-03-03

* **Feature:** Added optional HTTP timeout support via `ConnectionParameters` on `DefaultCacheManager`.
  * `connectionTimeout` limits time waiting for response headers.
  * `requestTimeout` applies an inactivity timeout while streaming response bytes.
  * Existing behavior is preserved when `connectionParameters` is not provided.
* Added tests for timeout behavior and client cleanup on timeout.

## [4.5.0] - 2026-03-02

* **Feature:** Added web platform support. The package can now be used in Flutter web apps.
  * Web caching uses Hive CE backed by IndexedDB — no new dependencies needed.
  * Image bytes and metadata are stored in Hive boxes on web instead of the file system.
  * Disk-based image resizing is skipped on web (originals are cached as-is).
  * The `DefaultCacheManager` is now conditionally imported per platform (IO/web).

## [4.4.0] - 2026-02-27

* **Feature:** Skip placeholder and fade animations when images are loaded from disk cache. Cached images now appear instantly without unnecessary visual flicker.
* Added `disablePlaceholderOnCacheHit` parameter (default `true`) to opt out of this behavior.
* `CachedNetworkImage` is now a `StatefulWidget` to support async cache pre-checking.

## [4.3.0] - 2026-02-26

* **Feature/Deprecation:** Added `errorBuilder` to `CachedNetworkImage` and `CachedImageWidget`, which aligns with Flutter's standard `ImageErrorWidgetBuilder`. The old `errorWidget` property is now deprecated.
* **Fix:** Resolved a memory leak where `errorListener` would prevent `CachedNetworkImage` from being garbage collected. Uses `addEphemeralErrorListener` on Flutter >= 3.16.

## [4.2.0] - 2026-02-23

* **Feature:** Added SVG support via new `unsupportedImageBuilder` callback
  * New `UnsupportedImageFormatException` thrown when image format is not supported by Flutter's standard codec
  * New `ImageFormatDetector` utility with content sniffing for SVG detection
  * Images are still cached normally; only rendering path differs
  * Example app updated with SVG demo using `flutter_svg`
  * 24 new tests added (18 format detection + 6 widget integration)
  * See README for usage example

## [4.1.1] - 2026-02-20

* **Fix:** Removed global `Hive.init()` usage from `DefaultCacheManager` to avoid conflicts with host app Hive initialization
* **Fix:** Added initialization synchronization in `DefaultCacheManager` to prevent parallel cold-start race conditions
* **Fix:** Switched cache metadata box opening to explicit `openBox(path: ...)` on a private Hive instance for reliable isolation
* **Feature:** Added optional `cacheDirectoryProvider` parameter to `DefaultCacheManager` so apps can control cache storage location
* **Tests:** Added regression tests for Hive init conflicts, concurrent initialization races, and cache directory resilience scenarios

## [4.1.0] - 2026-02-19

* **Feature:** Added `httpClientFactory` parameter to `DefaultCacheManager` for HTTP client dependency injection, enabling easy mocking in tests
* **Refactor:** Replaced raw `Map<String, dynamic>` with typed `CacheEntryMetadata` class for all cache metadata operations
* **Tests:** Comprehensive test coverage (131 tests, 86% coverage)
  * `DefaultCacheManager`: HTTP download success/errors, progress reporting, header forwarding, cache hit/miss/stale behavior, cleanup logic (31 tests)
  * Leak tests: StreamController closure, `http.Client` cleanup, file sink closure, `ImageLoader` chunkEvents, `MultiImageStreamCompleter` disposal, Hive box lifecycle (19 tests)
  * `ImageLoader`, `CachedNetworkImageProvider`, `CacheEntryMetadata` coverage
* **Fix:** Resolved analyzer warnings across all packages
